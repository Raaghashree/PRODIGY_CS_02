Pixel Manipluation for Image Encryption

This Python program encrypts and decrypts images using pixel manipulation. It modifies pixel values through XOR operations with a randomly generated key, ensuring reversible encryption. The encrypted image is saved, and upon decryption, the original image is restored. Designed for basic image security, this method provides a simple yet effective way to obscure image data.
